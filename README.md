I have focused on these pointers while doing data cleaning :-

Clarity: The first sentence now clearly states that the data cleaning process is being discussed.

Specificity: The original list of techniques has been expanded upon with specific examples of each technique. For instance, "changed data to their proper type" has been expanded to "converted the data to its proper type to ensure consistency and accuracy."

Conciseness: The original list has been rephrased and condensed to improve readability. For example, "removed rows containing null values" is more concise than "removed rows that contain null values."

Accuracy: The term "unnecessary double type" has been clarified as "unnecessary double types to integer" to make the writing more accurate.

Completeness: The original list has been expanded to include additional information on how some columns were transformed into different columns to extract more valuable insights.
